/* 
 * 4. D.I.Y. Accordion
 * 
 * The accordion is version of the disclosure element where only one
 * panel is open at a time. This small change is surprisingly
 * impactful, as it requires us to somehow keep track of the state of
 * all of the panels.
 * 
 * For an interactive reference, see:
 * https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/accordion
 *
 * TASK: 
 * For your first attempt, create the elements using HTML, style
 * them with your own CSS (there is an extra `styles.css` in this
 * folder) and wire it all together with the script. There are also
 * some .svg icons that you might want to use. See the modal example
 * for how to integrate those.
 * 
 * EXTRA: 
 * - Do the assignment again, but this time create the elements using
 *   the DOM interface, i.e. with `createElement` and `append`.
 *   + This is a lot more challenging, as it requires to deal with a
 *     higher degree of indirection.

  Eeek, a blank page! The worst.
  But don't fret! If you feel like you don't know where to start (and
  how could one?) let me give you my best advice:

  - Start by making the static HTML of the widget in its "target" state,
  in the case of the accordion, I would make three sections, with one being open.
  - Add interactivity step by step, starting with one section.
  - Once you have one section working, try to extand it to the other ones.
  You will often have to re-evaluate/improve your solutions in this step.
  - Repeat the implementation until you have a working prototype!

  Follow these steps, and I'm 100% sure you can do it! :)
