/* 
 * 3. Modal, or alert popup
 * 
 * TASK: Fill in the blanks to make the widget work.
 * We are making a model, also known as an "alert" or "popup" that
 * takes over the screen, prompting the user if they _really_ want to
 * delete the widget once they have pushed the button.
 *
 * This script is a bit longer than the ones we have seen, but a
 * majority of it is simply creating new elements, adding the
 * corresponding classes/eventsListeners and then assembling them.
 * 
 * This approach is different to the one we took when we made the
 * hamburger menu. For the modal, it makes more sense to dynamically
 * add, and consequently remove, elements as they are needed. Unlike a
 * hamburger, which we could argue is always "there", modals are
 * created in a more a la carte fashion.
